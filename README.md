## IPL Data Analysis and winner prediction model based on 2008-24 data

This notebook presents a comprehensive analysis of Indian Premier League (IPL) data from the inception of the league in 2008 through to the most recent season in 2024, with the goal of uncovering key insights, trends, and patterns within the data. It includes data collection and preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize key metrics such as win rates, player performance, and team statistics, and statistical insights to identify significant factors influencing match outcomes. The notebook then introduces a Random Forest Classification model to predict the winner of the 2025 IPL season, explaining the model’s features, training, validation, and performance evaluation. The results section presents the model’s predictions for the 2025 season, discusses the potential strengths and limitations of the model, and provides insights into the predicted performance of teams and key players. The primary objective is to leverage historical IPL data to build a predictive model that forecasts future match outcomes, offering a data-driven prediction for the 2025 IPL winner while illustrating the application of machine learning techniques to real-world sports data.
